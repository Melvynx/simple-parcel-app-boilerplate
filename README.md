# simple-parcel-app-boilerplate

Boilerplate for simple HTML website using `<include src="..." />` syntaxe.

I was inspired by this [website](https://antjanus.com/blog/web-development-tutorials/front-end-development/simple-html-css-workflow-with-parcel/).

## Usage

Clone this repository and run `npm install`.

After that, you can use :

`npm run dev`: to run local server with hot reload.

`npm run build`: to build the website for production.
